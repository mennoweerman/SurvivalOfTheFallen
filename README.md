# Survival Of The Fallen
In deze repository vind je de informatie over het examen project.
Omschrijf de examenopdracht evt de klant en wat het doel voor de klant is.

#### Het idee van de game is:  
Een first person survival game waarmee je doormiddel van materialen verzamelen wapens en voorwerpen kan creeÃ«ren om jezelf en je basis te beschermen. Je kan je basis maken op verschillende werelden die je weer kan ontgrendelen doormiddel van levels.

# Geproduceerde Game Onderdelen

## Scriptable Objects gemaakt door Menno

Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line.
